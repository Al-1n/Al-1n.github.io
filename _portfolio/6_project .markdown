**About the project**

![](/img/python_icon.png) ![](/img/jupyter_icon.png)

This repository contains Python code for analyzing data from a real-world quantum mechanics experiment. The experiment involved using liquid helium to reduce the temperature of the josephson junction to a level where Cooper pairs propagate with zero resistance.

# Background
<br/>  

Most commonly, Josephson junctions are constructed of three layers: two superconducting layers with a verry thin barrier layer in between.

Josephson junctions offer several advantages for quantum computing applications. Their compact size and scalability enable the fabrication of densely packed qubit arrays, while their inherent coherence and low decoherence rates ensure that quantum information can be maintained for extended periods. Additionally, Josephson junctions can be precisely controlled and coupled using external magnetic fields, facilitating the manipulation and entanglement of qubits.

Through the phenomenon of superposition, these qubits can exist in multiple states simultaneously, exponentially expanding computational possibilities.

# Advantages of Quantum Computers and Superconducting Qubits

Quantum computers have several advantages over classical computers. They can solve certain problems that are intractable for classical computers, such as factoring large numbers. They can also be used to simulate complex systems, such as molecules and materials.

Superconducting qubits have several advantages over other qubit candidates. They are relatively easy to fabricate, and they have long coherence times, which means that they can maintain their quantum states for extended periods of time. Additionally, superconducting qubits can be coupled together using external magnetic fields, which facilitates the manipulation and entanglement of qubits.

**How to use this project**

The analysis and dashboard were performed entirely using Tableau Public. There is no repository of project files. The purpose of the project was to teach myself Tableau and showcase what I learned using the interactive dashboard.

# Background
<br/>

The employee attrition dataset currently in use revolves around a fictional software company called Atlas Labs. It was originally presented as a Business Intelligence challenge on Datacamp. If you'd like to explore further details, you can visit the competition page by following this link: [HR Analytics in Tableau](https://app.datacamp.com/learn/competitions/hr-analytics-tableau). Below, you'll discover a summary of the analysis findings.

### Summary of insights drawn from the analysis
<br/>
1.Attrition Rate: Out of a total of 1,470 employees, 237 have left the company, indicating an attrition rate of approximately 16%.

2.Gender Differences: There is a slightly higher attrition rate among males compared to females, suggesting a potential gender-related trend.

3.Age Group Analysis: Employees in the under 30 age group tend to have a higher likelihood of leaving the company, indicating a potential issue with retention in this demographic.

4.Age Group Comparison: Surprisingly, the age group between 30 and 40 years old shows the lowest level of attrition, implying higher job satisfaction and engagement within this cohort.

5.Younger Workforce Impact: The observed tendency of younger employees towards attrition may not be statistically significant due to the presence of a larger number of younger employees compared to older age groups.

6.Salary Influence: Both employees with low and high salaries demonstrate a higher level of attrition compared to those with medium salaries, suggesting potential dissatisfaction among those at the extreme ends of the salary spectrum.

7.Department and Job Role Analysis: Within the tech department, data scientists and software engineers experience the highest attrition rates, while in the sales department, sales executives face the highest attrition levels. Conversely, employees in managerial positions exhibit the lowest attrition rates across departments.

These findings highlight critical areas of concern for the organization, including the need to address attrition among younger employees, evaluate salary structures, and implement targeted retention strategies in specific job roles and departments. By addressing these issues, the organization can work towards reducing attrition and improving employee retention, ultimately leading to a more stable and engaged workforce.
